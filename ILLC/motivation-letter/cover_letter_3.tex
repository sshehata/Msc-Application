%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I would like to express my wish to join the Master of Logic program (MSc
  Logic) of the ILLC starting September 2015.
  Allow me to provide some information that may further support my application.
  I am currently a senior Computer Science and Engineering student at the German
  University in Cairo. My interest in computer science began with learning C at the age of twelve,
  followed by other languages such as C++, visual basic. I mainly practiced on
  small projects for my own use.  

  Following high school, I decided to follow a career in computer science. I was
  offered a partial scholarship to join the Bachelor Program in Computer Science
  and Engineering of the German University in Cairo.I am currently in my senior
  year and expected to graduate next semester with highest honors. I am
  currently ranked the second top student of my class with GPA: $0.89$ . My
  chosen study track was mainly focused on Logic,  Theory of Computation and
  Artificial Intelligence. I covered courses of First Order Logic,  Knowledge
  Representation and Reasoning, Machine Learning,  Analysis and Design of
  Algorithms and Declarative and Functional
  programming. During my study, I attended several extra-curricular courses and
  workshops abroad such as the CHR workshop 2013 in Berlin. These trips were
  funded by my university as a reward of academic excellence. Finally, I did my
  Bachelor Project during my stay in Augsburg university as an exchange student,
  under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Elizabeth Andre. My Thesis was titled the
  Emotion Classification: Sentimental Analysis over EEG. My stay there was also
  funded by my university.
  
  My main interest in Logic is due to its contribution to the field of
  Artificial Intelligence. I aspire to join a career in Artificial Intelligence
  research. I believe it is the key to understanding the most computationally
  capable construct in existence, the human brain. For that I have become
  involved with AI research community, as well as taken several internships
  relating to the field including an internship with Intel Egypt Corporation.
  Currently, I am part of an effort to start an Artificial Intelligence research
  group in the German University in Cairo, in which I am mainly responsible of
  Machine Learning and Data Mining research.

  In order to further pursue my goal, I decided to take a Master's program in
  Logic. Many breakthroughs in AI are attributed to new
  developments in logical theory. New generation expert systems rely heavily on
  logic for reasoning and representing their often very large and complex
  Knowledge bases. Problems such as planning, natural language processing as
  well as the abstract concepts of rationality and common sense, all require
  a strong logical framework to be able to understand and solve.

  After reviewing the top Master's programs in Logic offered around the world, 
  I find that the ILLC program is the most suited or me. It is known as one of
  the oldest, most prestigious programs in this discipline.  It was recommended by several of my
  professors as the top Logic program currently offered, and the recent
  attention it has received from accreditation committees show the excellent
  standards of learning it holds. Furthermore, having gone over some of the
  MoL theses, its clear that the program is research directed encouraging true
  contributions to the field. I also look forward to being part of the
  University of Amsterdam, one of the largest and most distinct research
  University in Europe. Regarding the content of the
  program, I am most interested in the Logic and Computation track as well as
  courses such as Game Theory, Proof Theory and Cognitive Modelling.

  In conclusion, I would like to point out that I am a hard working student,
  eager to learn and will be happy to share my passion towards scientific
  research should I be given the opportunity to join this program. I believe that I will truly benefit from
  such an opportunity and in return I would be able to be of benefit to the
  scientific and research community.
