%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I would like to express my wish to join the Master's Program in Security and
  Mobile Computing. Allow me to provide some information that may further support my application.
  I am currently a senior Computer Science and Engineering student at the German
  University in Cairo.  My interest in computer science began with learning C at the age of twelve,
  followed by other languages such as C++, visual basic. I mainly practiced on
  small projects for my own use.  

  Following high school, I decided to follow a career in computer science. I was
  offered a partial scholarship to join the Bachelor Program in Computer Science
  and Engineering of the German University in Cairo. I am currently in my senior
  year and expected to graduate next semester with highest honors. I am
  currently ranked the second top student of my class with GPA: $0.89/0.7$. My
  chosen study track covered courses of Computer and Network Security, Machine Learning, Knowledge
  Representation and Reasoning, First Order Logic, Analysis and Design of
  Algorithms and Declarative and Functional
  programming. I also included some general courses such as Software Engineering
  and Computer Graphics. During my study, I attended several extra-curricular courses and
  workshops abroad such as the CHR workshop 2013 in Berlin. These trips were
  funded by my university as a reward of academic excellence. Finally, I did my
  Bachelor Project during my stay in Augsburg university as an exchange student,
  under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Elizabeth Andre. My Thesis was titled the
  Emotion Classification: Sentimental Analysis over EEG. My stay there was also
  funded by my university.

  I was involved in several internships relating to web development,
  including a website for the university itself. I have also done internships
  with Intel Egypt Corporation and The Augsburg University HCM lab. Currently,
  I am part of an effort to start an Artificial
  Intelligence research group in the German University in Cairo, in which I am
  mainly responsible of Machine Learning and Data Mining research. While I have
  tried to gather a diverse experience in the fields of computer science,
  networking and security have recently become my main focus. With the sheer
  abundance of information across the net, vulnerable systems and crackable
  networks are more dangerous than ever. Furthermore, new systems must be able
  to handle unprecedented traffic stress with the scale of user bases continuing
  to increase exponentially. Today, all fields demand systems that
  guarantee reliability, security and scalability. 

  In addition to university courses, I have strived to increase my knowledge
  with the field in several ways, including covering cryptography courses
  offered by Coursera.com. In order to gain the necessary knowledge base and
  research skills for me to pursue a career in networks security, I decided to
  take a Master's program in systems security and networking. After reviewing
  the top universities that offer such a program, I find the NordSecMob program
  most suited to my goals. The program's connection to some of the most
  prestigious educational institutions in Europe guarantee high standards of
  education. Also, having gone over the list of publications made
  throughout the program, it is clear that the program is research directed,
  encouraging true contributions to the field. Regarding the content of the
  program, I am most interested in the Information Security and Cryptography
  foundations specializations.
  
  In conclusion, I would like to point out that I am a hard working student,
  passionate, eager to learn and will be happy to share my passion towards the
  fields should I be given the  opportunity to join this program. I believe
  that I will truly benefit from
  such an opportunity and in return I would be able to be of benefit to the
  scientific and research community.
